Foreword 
This  Standard  is  one  of  the  series  of  ECSS  Standards  intended  to  be  applied  together  for  the 
management,  engineering  and  product  assurance  in  space  projects  and  applications.  ECSS  is  a 
cooperative  effort  of  the  European  Space  Agency,  national  space  agencies  and  European  industry 
associations for the purpose of developing and maintaining common standards. Requirements in this 
Standard are defined in terms of what shall be accomplished, rather than in terms of how to organize 
and  perform  the  necessary  work.  This  allows  existing  organizational  structures  and  methods  to  be 
applied where they are effective, and for the structures and methods to evolve as necessary without 
rewriting the standards. 
This  Standard  has  been  prepared  by  the  ECSS-E-ST-20-20  Working  Group,  reviewed  by  the  ECSS 
Executive Secretariat and approved by the ECSS Technical Authority.

Introduction 

This standard identifies the requirements needed to specify, procure or develop 
a  space  power  distribution  based  on  Latching  Current  Limiters,  both  from 
source and load perspective. 
For a reference architecture description, it is possible to refer to ECSS-E-HB-20-20. 
ECSS-E-HB-20-20  includes  a  clarification  of  the  principles  of  operation  of  a 
power distribution based on LCLs, identifies important issues related to LCLs 
and explains the requirements of the present standard. 
Note that the present issue of the standard covers electrical design and interface 
requirements for power distribution based on Latching Current Limiters only. 
Future issues of the present standard will cover additional power interfaces.

Scope 

The target  applications covered  by this standard  are all missions traditionally 
provided  with  power  distribution  and  protection  by  LCLs/RLCLs  (science, 
earth  observation,  navigation)  with  exclusion  of  applications  for  which  the 
power distribution and protection is provided by fuses (e.g. most of the GEO 
telecom satellites). 
The present standard applies to power distribution by LCLs/RLCLs for power 
systems, and in general for satellites, required to be Single Point Failure Free.  
The  present  standard  document  applies  exclusively  to  the  main  bus  power 
distribution by LCLs/RLCLs to external satellite loads. 
A particular case of LCLs (Heater LCLs, or HLCLs) is also treated. The HLCLs 
are the protections elements of the power distribution to the thermal heaters in 
a spacecraft. 
Internal power system protections of LCLs/RLCLs are not covered. 
Paralleling of LCLs to increase power supply line reliability is not covered by 
the  present  standard,  since  this  choice  does  not  appreciably  change  the 
reliability of the overall function (i.e. LCL plus load). 
In fact, a typical reliability figure of the LCL (limited to the loss of its switch-on 
capability) is 20 FIT or less. 
If the load to be connected to the LCL line has a substantial higher failure rate 
than this, it is not necessary to duplicate the LCL to supply that load. 
 
This standard may be tailored for the specific characteristic and constrains of a 
space project in conformance with ECSS-S-ST-00.

3.4  Nomenclature 

The following nomenclature applies throughout this document: 
a. 

The  word  âshallâ  is  used  in  this  Standard  to  express  requirements.  All 
the requirements are expressed with the word âshallâ. 
The word âshouldâ is used in this Standard to express recommendations. 
All the recommendations are expressed with the word âshouldâ. 

b. 

c. 

NOTE  

It is expected that, during tailoring, 
recommendations in this document are either 
converted into requirements or tailored out. 

The  words  âmayâ  and  âneed  notâ  are  used  in  this  Standard  to  express 
positive  and  negative  permissions,  respectively.  All  the  positive 
permissions  are  expressed  with  the  word  âmayâ.  All  the  negative 
permissions are expressed with the words âneed notâ. 

19 

ECSS-E-ST-20-20C 
15 April 2016 

d. 

The  word  âcanâ  is  used  in  this  Standard  to  express  capabilities  or 
possibilities,  and  therefore,  if  not  accompanied  by  one  of  the  previous 
words, it implies descriptive text. 

NOTE  

In  ECSS  âmayâ  and  âcanâ  have  completely 
different  meanings:  âmayâ 
is  normative 
(permission), and âcanâ is descriptive. 

e. 

The  present  and  past  tenses  are  used  in  this  Standard  to  express 
statements of fact, and therefore they imply descriptive text.

Principles 

4.1  General 

The  indicated  requirements  verification  (see  clause  5)  identifies  the  overall 
applicable  methods  to  confirm  compliance  to  the  requirements,  without 
explicitly  explaining  how  the  verification  is  split  at  applicability  level 
(equipment,  SSE/SSS  or  SSE/SSS/equipment).  The  verification  methods 
suggested for the verification of the requirements are listed in Annex A. 

4.2  Standard assumptions 

a. 

b. 

The  assumption  for  the  maximum  qualification  temperature  of  the  unit 
hosting the power distribution LCLs/RLCLs/HLCLs is 70 Â°C. 
The bus voltage time derivative at bus application or removal varies from 
0 V/Âµs to 0,1 V/ Âµs.

The LCL design should be capable to withstand the application of reverse 
current by the load, both in ON and in OFF conditions. 

5.2.12 Parallel connection 

5.2.12.1  LCLs in parallel 

5.2.12.1.1  Nominal case

ECSS-E-ST-20-20C 
15 April 2016 

5.2.13.1.1  Fault case 
a. 

For LCL/HLCL, if no additional switching capability is provided as per 
5.2.13.3.1a, the power budget shall cover the LCL/HLCL switch failure by 
considering the actual MB maximum load, plus eventually the unwanted 
load connected to the failed LCL/HLCL, in the following cases: 
1. 

all  the  load  operational  modes  imply  a  non-negligible  power 
consumption; 
the load operational modes cannot be directly commanded by an 
autonomous,  on  board  load  shedding  routine  to  be  triggered  by 
abnormal bus load consumption.

NOTE 2  The  LCL  switch  is  the  only  switch  in  the 

relevant distribution line. 

5.2.13.2  No additional switching capability, negligible load 

power consumption mode 

5.2.13.2.1  Nominal case 
a. 

For LCL/HLCL, the load power consumption considered as negligible in 
terms of power budget shall be specified by the system integrator. 

NOTE  

The "negligible" power consumption is 
intended as the one that can be drawn from the 
power bus without the system integrator or 
system responsible being forced to disconnect 
it. 
Such power level is indeed added to the power 
budget. 

5.2.13.3  Additional switching capability 

5.2.13.3.1  Nominal and fault cases 
a. 

For  LCL/HLCL,  in  case  that  there  is  an  additional  switch  that  can  be 
commanded open in any case when the LCL/HLCL switch is in ON state 
or  fails  ON  or  in  short  circuit,  requirements  5.2.13.4.1a  and  5.2.13.5.1a 
should be fulfilled. 
It  shall  be  possible  to  command  the  LCL/HLCL  and  the  relevant 
additional  switch  in  series  by  a  different,  individual  command,  or  a 
different commanding path.

For LCL, the additional switch should be put on power system LCL side. 

5.2.13.5  Additional switching capability, UVP acting on 

additional switch 

5.2.13.5.1  Nominal and fault cases 
a. 

For  LCL,  the  UVP  should  act  both  on  the  LCL  switch  and  on  the 
additional switch provided by an independent memory cell. 

NOTE  

Each switch which is supposed to maintain its 
ON (or OFF) status is provided with a memory 
cell (a flip-flop or other). See Figures 5-29 and 5-
30 of ECSS-E-HB-20-20. 

5.2.14 LCL Switch dissipative failure 

5.2.14.1  Steady state condition 

5.2.14.1.1  Fault case 
a. 

In case the LCL/RLCL/HLCL switch fails in a dissipative failure and in 
case  no  other  protection  removes  the  failure,  all  the  surrounding 
components shall be within derating. 

NOTE  

Surrounding  components  are  the  ones  not 
relevant to the failed LCL. 

5.2.14.2  Transient condition 

5.2.14.2.1  Fault case 
a. 

In case the LCL/RLCL/HLCL switch fails in a dissipative failure and in

Requirements mapping 

Test (T), 
Analysis (A), 
Review-of-design (RoD), and 
Inspection (I). 

Table  A-1  to  Table  A-4  provide  a  compact  view  of  the  requirements  of  the 
present standard, including the verification method suggested for each of them. 
According to ECSS-E-ST-10-02, the verification is accomplished by one or more 
of the following verification methods: 
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
In  addition  to  the  methods  of  verification  specified  in  ECSS-E-ST-10-02,  the 
present annex includes the test verification at design qualification level (T*). 
The  test  verification  at  design  qualification  level  (T*)  is  intended  to  be 
performed on an electrical representative version of the hardware, on a set up 
not  necessarily  equal  to  the  final  flight  one,  to  be  established  for  the  LCL 
distribution product line by the relevant manufacturer. 

NOTE  

If  not  stated  otherwise,  any  reference  to  the 
handbook  inside  the  tables,  is  a  reference  to 
ECSS-E-HB-20-20. 

Level 3 heading in this standard (for example, 5.2.14 âLCL Switch dissipative 
failureâ) is reported as âfeatureâ in Table A-1 to Table A-4. 
Level 4 heading in this standard (for example, 5.2.14.1 âSteady state conditionâ) 
is reported as âsub-featureâ in Table A-1 to Table A-4. 
The  suggested  applicability  level  indicated  in  Table  A-1  to  Table  A-4 
(SSE/SSS/Equipment)  is  intended  in  and/or-option  (SSE  and/or  SSS  and/or 
Equipment).

For LCL/HLCL, if no additional switching capability is 
provided as per 5.2.13.3.1a, the power budget shall cover 
the LCL/HLCL switch failure by considering the actual 
MB maximum load, plus eventually the unwanted load 
connected to the failed LCL/HLCL, in the following cases: 
1. all the load operational modes imply a non-negligible 
power consumption 
2. the load operational modes cannot be directly 
commanded by an autonomous, on board load shedding 
routine to be triggered by abnormal bus load 
consumption. 

For LCL/HLCL, the load power consumption considered 
as negligible in terms of power budget shall be specified 
by the system integrator. 
For LCL/HLCL, in case that there is an additional switch 
that can be commanded open in any case when the 
LCL/HLCL switch is in ON state or fails ON or in short 
circuit, requirements 5.2.13.4.1a and 5.2.13.5.1a should be 
fulfilled. 
It shall be possible to command the LCL/HLCL and the 
relevant additional switch in series by a different, 
individual command, or a different commanding path. 
For LCL, the additional switch should be put on power 
system LCL side. 

For LCL, the UVP should act both on the LCL switch and 
on the additional switch provided by an independent 
memory cell. 
In case the LCL/RLCL/HLCL switch fails in a dissipative 
failure and in case no other protection removes the failure, 
all the surrounding components shall be within derating.

During nominal operation after switch-on, the load 
current for LCL/RLCL/HLCL shall always be smaller than 
the correspondent class current. 
Requirement 5.3.1.1.1a shall be valid also in the following 
conditions: 
1. the bus voltage transients are applied, and 
3. there are load-conducted emissions as per the EMC 
specification. 
During Switch-on, the load current shall not exceed the 
LCL/RLCL class current except for charging the relevant 
input filter. 
Converters contained in the load shall start up without the 
load current to exceed the LCL/RLCL class current. 
If the LCL/RLCL current limit is reached, the load input 
filter shall be completely charged within the relevant 
LCL/RLCL maximum charge time defined in requirement 
5.4.2.3.1a. 
In case the LCL/RLCL switch fails in a dissipative failure 
mode, the load shall perform one of the following actions: 
1. work nominally,  
2. enter autonomously a safe operating condition, or  
3. survive the condition without abnormal conducted or 
radiated emissions. 
A representative LCL/RLCL interface should be used 
during the standalone tests of any load connected to it. 
In case an UVP at load side is present, the repetitive 
overload pattern that can result from the interaction with
