ECSS-E-ST-20-20C15 April 2016- Foreword

- This  Standard  is  one  of  the  series  of  ECSS  Standards  intended  to  be  applied  together  for  the

- management,  engineering  and  product  assurance  in  space  projects  and  applications.  ECSS  is  a

- cooperative  effort  of  the  European  Space  Agency,  national  space  agencies  and  European  industry

- associations for the purpose of developing and maintaining common standards. Requirements in this

- Standard are defined in terms of what shall be accomplished, rather than in terms of how to organize

- and  perform  the  necessary  work.  This  allows  existing  organizational  structures  and  methods  to  be

- applied where they are effective, and for the structures and methods to evolve as necessary without

- rewriting the standards.

- This  Standard  has  been  prepared  by  the  ECSS-E-ST-20-20  Working  Group,  reviewed  by  the  ECSS

- Executive Secretariat and approved by the ECSS Technical Authority.

ECSS-E-ST-20-20C15 April 2016IntroductionThis standard identifies the requirements needed to specify, procure or developa  space  power  distribution  based  on  Latching  Current  Limiters,  both  fromsource and load perspective.

For a reference architecture description, it is possible to refer to ECSS-E-HB-20-20.ECSS-E-HB-20-20  includes  a  clarification  of  the  principles  of  operation  of  apower distribution based on LCLs, identifies important issues related to LCLsand explains the requirements of the present standard.

Note that the present issue of the standard covers electrical design and interfacerequirements for power distribution based on Latching Current Limiters only.Future issues of the present standard will cover additional power interfaces.![Im0](images/Im0)

ECSS-E-ST-20-20C15 April 2016ScopeThe target  applications covered  by this standard  are all missions traditionallyprovided  with  power  distribution  and  protection  by  LCLs/RLCLs  (science,earth  observation,  navigation)  with  exclusion  of  applications  for  which  thepower distribution and protection is provided by fuses (e.g. most of the GEOtelecom satellites).

The present standard applies to power distribution by LCLs/RLCLs for powersystems, and in general for satellites, required to be Single Point Failure Free.The  present  standard  document  applies  exclusively  to  the  main  bus  powerdistribution by LCLs/RLCLs to external satellite loads.

A particular case of LCLs (Heater LCLs, or HLCLs) is also treated. The HLCLsare the protections elements of the power distribution to the thermal heaters ina spacecraft.

Internal power system protections of LCLs/RLCLs are not covered.

Paralleling of LCLs to increase power supply line reliability is not covered bythe  present  standard,  since  this  choice  does  not  appreciably  change  thereliability of the overall function (i.e. LCL plus load).

In fact, a typical reliability figure of the LCL (limited to the loss of its switch-oncapability) is 20 FIT or less.

If the load to be connected to the LCL line has a substantial higher failure ratethan this, it is not necessary to duplicate the LCL to supply that load.

This standard may be tailored for the specific characteristic and constrains of aspace project in conformance with ECSS-S-ST-00.
