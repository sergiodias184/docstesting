Foreword 
This  Standard  is  one  of  the  series  of  ECSS  Standards  intended  to  be  applied  together  for  the 
management,  engineering  and  product  assurance  in  space  projects  and  applications.  ECSS  is  a 
cooperative  effort  of  the  European  Space  Agency,  national  space  agencies  and  European  industry 
associations for the purpose of developing and maintaining common standards. Requirements in this 
Standard are defined in terms of what shall be accomplished, rather than in terms of how to organize 
and  perform  the  necessary  work.  This  allows  existing  organizational  structures  and  methods  to  be 
applied where they are effective, and for the structures and methods to evolve as necessary without 
rewriting the standards. 
This  Standard  has  been  prepared  by  the  ECSS-Q-ST-20  Working  Group,  reviewed  by  the  ECSS 
Executive Secretariat and approved by the ECSS Technical Authority. 

Disclaimer 
ECSS does not provide any warranty whatsoever, whether expressed, implied, or statutory, including, 
but not limited to, any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or any warranty 
that  the  contents  of  the  item  are  error-free.  In  no  respect  shall  ECSS  incur  any  liability  for  any 
damages, including, but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages arising out 
of, resulting from, or in any way connected to the use of this Standard, whether or not based upon 
warranty, business agreement, tort, or otherwise; whether or not injury was sustained by persons or 
property or otherwise; and whether or not loss was sustained from, or arose out of, the results of, the 
item, or any services that may be provided by ECSS.

NOTE  

It  is  expected  that,  during  tailoring,  all  the 
recommendations  in  this  document  are  either 
converted into requirements or tailored out. 

The  words  “may”  and  “need  not”  are  used  in  this  standard  to  express 
positive  and  negative  permissions  respectively.  All 
the  positive 
permissions  are  expressed  with  the  word  “may”.  All  the  negative 
permissions are expressed with the words “need not”. 
The  word  “can”  is  used  in  this  standard  to  express  capabilities  or 
possibilities,  and  therefore,  if  not  accompanied  by  one  of  the  previous 
words, it implies descriptive text. 

NOTE  

In  ECSS  “may”  and  “can”  have  a  complete 
different  meaning: 
is  normative 
(permission) and “can” is descriptive. 

“may” 

e. 

The present and past tense are used in this standard to express statement 
of fact, and therefore they imply descriptive text.

Quality assurance principles 

4.1  QA management principles 

The prime objective of Quality Assurance (QA) management is to ensure that a 
QA programme for projects covering  mission definition, design, development 
and production of space systems is established, maintained and implemented. 
All  QA  requirements  are  specified  through  definition  and  implementation  of 
adequate methods and procedures. 
Personnel whose performance determines or affects product quality are trained 
and certified in accordance with project needs. 

4.2  General principles 

The implementation of the following phase-independent activities is ensured by 
the QA function throughout the lead-time of projects: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

critical-items control 
nonconformance control 
alert management 
stamp control 
traceability 
metrology and calibration 
handling, storage and preservation 
statistical quality control (if required by the business agreement). 

4.3  Design and verification principles 

The objective of the QA function is to ensure that: 
a. 

a set of design rules and methods has been set up and is consistent with 
the project techniques and technologies; 

b.  methods, procedures and tools have been defined and are implemented 
in  order  to  prove  that  each  applicable  requirement  is  verified  through 
one or more of the following methods: analysis, inspection, test, review 
of design, audits; 
the  design  is  producible  and  repeatable  and  that  the  resulting  product 
can be verified and operated within the required operating limits; 

c. 

14 

ECSS-Q-ST-20C Rev.1 
1 March 2013 

d. 

e. 

f. 

design and verification activities are planned in a consistent and logical 
way; 
the  verification  process  is  complete  and  includes  clear  test,  test  model 
and verification logic; 
a defined qualification approach is implemented to demonstrate that the 
item performs satisfactorily in the intended environment. 

4.4  Procurement principles 
including  selection  of  procurement  sources, 
All  procurement  activities 
procurement  documents,  procurement  source  surveillance  and  receiving 
inspection are controlled to ensure that all procured items and services conform 
to requirements. 

4.5  Manufacturing, assembly and integration principles 

All  manufacturing,  assembly  and  integration  operations  are  planned  and 
performed  in  coordination  with  inspections  and  tests  to  ensure  that  the 
deliverables are built, assembled and integrated to the approved configuration 
baseline. 
Special processes and new technologies are identified in a timely manner and 
adequate  evaluation  or  qualification  activities  should  be  implemented  in  line 
with the overall schedule. 

4.6  Testing principles 

Test  facilities  and  test  equipment  are  validated  prior  to  their  use  to  ensure 
conformance to project requirements. 
All  tests  are  performed  in  accordance  with  documented  and  released 
procedures and results are comprehensively recorded. 

4.7  Acceptance and delivery principles 

The  objective  is  to  ensure  that  an  acceptance  and  delivery  process  is 
implemented  which  allows  demonstrating  and  documenting  the  conformance 
of the delivered item. 

4.8  GSE principles 

Design,  production,  delivery  and  maintenance  requirements  for  GSE  are 
defined  and  implemented  allowing  for  testability,  availability,  safety,  life 
duration, operability and ability to interface as necessary with space segment in 
a safe way.

Pre-tailoring matrix per space product 
types 

The Matrix of Table 6-1 presents the pre-tailoring of ECSS-Q-ST-20C Rev.1 per space product type. 
For the terminology and definitions of the space product types see ECSS-S-ST-00-01 which is quoted in 3.1. 

NOTE 1  In the matrix, the column “Software” is for consideration in the development 
of  software,  only  in  the  case  when  the  software  is  not  installed  in  a 
hardware. Since “Software product assurance” is covered by ECSS-Q-ST-80, 
this  document  is  not  applicable  to  SW  PA,  and  therefore  the  column 
“Software” in the matrix always states “NA”.  

NOTE 2  Catalogue  Off-the-shelf  equipment  is  off-the-shelf  equipment  that  is 
procured from a stock defined in a supplier catalogue. For example, a UNIX 
Server is a “Catalogue Off-the-shelf equipment” while a 30 m Antenna can 
be an off-the-shelf even it is built on order only. 

Definitions of the columns 

Column title 
Applicability 
status 

There are seven product types, one per column. 
For the column “i” (i = 1 to 8) possible values are: 

Description 

“A” when applicable, 
“NA” when not applicable, or  
“Xi” to be decided on a case by case basis, with explanation in column comments 

• 
• 
• 
•  A* when requirement is applicable with supplementary indications in the 

“Comment” column 

A requirement is considered applicable for a product type if it is verified on this 
product type. 
It is possible to have a requirement applicable at various level of product (system, 
element, equipment and software) 

• 

• 

If a requirement is verified only at one level, and the information transmitted to 
the upper level without any treatment, it will be considered applicable only at the 
level it was verified (“ Yes “ in the column where it is verified). 
If a requirement is verified at one level, and also verified at the upper level, it will 
be considered applicable at both levels (a “Yes “ in both columns). 

The column “Comments” shall be used to explain the rationale for having not decided if 
applicable or not. 
It shall not be used to modify a requirement but it can provide clarification on specific 
conditions for the applicability of the requirement.
