Foreword 
This  Standard  is  one  of  the  series  of  ECSS  Standards  intended  to  be  applied  together  for  the 
management,  engineering  and  product  assurance  in  space  projects  and  applications.  ECSS  is  a 
cooperative  effort  of  the  European  Space  Agency,  national  space  agencies  and  European  industry 
associations for the purpose of developing and maintaining common standards. Requirements in this 
Standard are defined in terms of what shall be accomplished, rather than in terms of how to organize 
and  perform  the  necessary  work.  This  allows  existing  organizational  structures  and  methods  to  be 
applied where they are effective, and for the structures and methods to evolve as necessary without 
rewriting the standards. 
This  Standard  has  been  prepared  by  the  ECSS-E-ST-31-02C  Working  Group,  reviewed  by  the  ECSS 
Executive Secretariat and approved by the ECSS Technical Authority.

Introduction 

This  Standard  is  based  on  ESA  PSS-49,  Issue  2  “Heat  pipe  qualification 
requirements”,  written  1983,  when  the  need  for  heat  pipes  in  several  ESA 
projects had been identified. At that time a number of European development 
activities were initiated to provide qualified heat pipes for these programmes, 
which culminated in a first heat pipe application on a European spacecraft in 
1981  (MARECS,  BR-200,  ESA  Achievements  -  More  Than  Thirty  Years  of 
Pioneering Space Activity, ESA November 30, 2001), followed by a first major 
application on a European communication satellite in 1987 (TV-SAT 1, German 
Communication Satellites). 
ESA PSS-49 was published at a time, when knowledge of heat pipe technology 
started  to  evolve  from  work  of  a  few  laboratories  in  Europe  (IKE,  University 
Stuttgart,  EURATOM  Research  Centre,  Ispra).  Several  wick  designs,  material 
combinations  and  heat  carrier  fluids  were  investigated  and  many  process 
related issues remained to be solved. From today’s view point the qualification 
requirements of ESA PSS-49 appear therefore very detailed, exhaustive and in 
some cases disproportionate in an effort to cover any not yet fully understood 
phenomena. As examples  the specified number of  qualification units (14), the 
number of required thermal cycles (800) and the extensive  mechanical testing 
(50 g constant acceleration, high level sine and random vibration) can be cited. 
The present Standard takes advantage of valid requirements of ESA PSS-49, but 
reflects  at  the  same  time  today’s  advanced  knowledge  of  two-phase  cooling 
technology,  which  can  be  found  with  European  manufacturers.  This  includes 
experience to select proven material combinations, reliable wick and container 
designs,  to  apply  well-established  manufacturing  and  testing  processes,  and 
develop  reliable  analysis  tools  to  predict  in-orbit  performance  of  flight 
hardware.  The  experience  is  also  based  on  numerous  successful  two-phase 
cooling system application in European spacecraft over the last 20 years. 
Besides stream-lining the ESA PSS-49, to arrive at today’s accepted set of heat 
pipe  qualification  requirements,  the  following  features  have  also  been  taken 
into account: 

Inclusion of qualification requirements for two-phase loops (CPL, LHP), 

• 
•  Reference to applicable requirements in other ECSS documents, 
•  Formatting  to  recent  ECSS  template  in  order  to  produce  a  document, 
which  can  be  used  in  business  agreements  between  customer  and 
supplier.

This  standard  defines  requirements  for 
equipment (TPHTE), for use in spacecraft thermal control.  
This standard is applicable to new hardware qualification activities. 
Requirements for mechanical pump driven loops (MPDL) are not included in 
the present version of this Standard. 
This standard includes definitions, requirements and DRDs from ECSS-E-ST-10-
02,  ECSS-E-ST-10-03,  and  ECSS-E-ST-10-06  applicable  to  TPHTE  qualification. 
Therefore,  these  three  standards  are  not  applicable  to  the  qualification  of 
TPHTE. 
This standard also includes definitions and part of the requirements of ECSS-E-
ST-32-02  applicable  to  TPHTE  qualification.  ECSS-E-ST-32-02  is  therefore 
applicable to the qualification of TPHTE. 
This standard does not include requirements for acceptance of TPHTE. 
This standard may be tailored for the specific characteristic and constrains of a 
space project in conformance with ECSS-S-ST-00.

TPHTE qualification principles 

4.1  TPHTE categorization 

TPHTE  are  considered  special  pressurized  hardware,  as  defined  in  clause  3. 
Requirements of ECSS-E-ST-32-02 are included in this Standard for this reason. 
The  TPHTE  are  categorized  in  Figure  4-1  according  to  their  design  and 
functional principle. 
Heat  pipes  consist  of  a  single  container  with  a  capillary  structure  extending 
over  the  entire  container  length.  Liquid  and  vapour  passages  are  arranged  in 
such a way that the two fluid phases move in counter flow. 
Capillary driven loops (CDL) have separate evaporator and condenser sections, 
which  are  connected  by  dedicated  vapour  and  liquid  tubing.  At  least  one 
capillary structure is located in the evaporator section, which serves as capillary 
pump to circulate the fluid in a true loop configuration. 
The mechanically pumped two-phase loop (MPDL) has a configuration, which 
is similar to the CDL, except that the circulation of the fluid is accomplished by 
a mechanical pump. 

NOTE  Requirements for MPDL are not included in the 

present version of this Standard. 

4.2 

Involved organizations 

The  qualification  process  of  TPHTE  is  generally  carried  out  by  a  specialized 
equipment manufacturer (called in this document “supplier”) and controlled by 
the qualification authority, which is called in this document the “customer”.  
The qualification activity is embedded in the supplier’s product assurance and 
quality organization and in most cases the supplier's quality assurance plan has 
been  established  and  approved  for  space  activities  independently  from  the 
TPHTE  qualification  process  specified  in  this  document.  It  is  the  task  of  the 
supplier’s  PA  authority  to  introduce  /  approve  adequate  product  assurance 
provisions  at  his  subcontractor(s).  The  existence  of  an  approved  PA  Plan  is 
precondition for commencing qualification activities.

4.3  Generic requirements in this standard 

The  present  document  provides  generic,  i.e.  not  project  specific  requirements 
for formal qualification of TPHTE. It is therefore important to select overall and 
enveloping  qualification  requirements  in  order  to  support  a  maximum  of 
spacecraft application without the need for delta qualification. 

16 

4.4  Processes, number of qualification units 

ECSS-E-ST-31-02C 
12 December 2012 

The qualification of TPHTE is based on qualified manufacturing processes (e.g. 
cleaning, surface treatment, welding and leak testing) and covers in general the 
following areas: 
• 

Performance over long operation time (compatibility between fluid and 
wall material, space radiation, leak tightness) 
Mechanical performance (strength, pressurized hardware) 
Thermal performance (e.g. heat transport capability, start-up behaviour, 
heat transfer coefficients) 

• 
• 

In this context the number of TPHTE units to be produced for the qualification 
program  are  evaluated  and  selected  by  the  supplier.  There  are  no  general 
applicable sources, which specify the minimum of units to be used to undergo 
identical  qualification  testing  in  order  to  arrive  at  a  successful  qualified 
product.  The  question  to  be  answered  for  each  TPHTE  configuration  is:  How 
many  identical  units  need  to  be  built  and  tested  in  order  to  verify  that 
production processes provide reproducible performance results. 
The following are possible selection criteria: 
• 
• 
• 

Experience of the manufacturer in production of similar products, 
Simplicity of the configuration, 
TPHTE  design  features,  which  have  inherent  capability  for  good 
repeatability of the production processes (e.g. simple axial grooved heat 
pipes). 

This  Standard  specifies  the  number  of  needed  units  submitted  to  the 
qualification  process  for  configurations,  which  are  currently  used  in  several 
spacecraft  applications.  It  is  recommended  that  the  supplier  performs  the 
selection  for other  configurations  and  provide  argumentation  to  the  customer 
for agreement of his choice. 
Compared  to  full  qualification  of  a  new  product  the  number  of  units  can  be 
reduced for delta qualification of an existing but modified product. 

4.5  Thermal and mechanical qualification 

Temperature range 

4.5.1 
In contrast to most of electronic equipment the performance of a TPHTE varies 
with its operating temperature, because properties of the used heat carrier are 
temperature  dependent.  For  heat  pipes  as  an  example,  important  fluid 
properties  can  be  grouped  into  a  figure-of-merit  (G),  which  is  the  product  of 
surface tension, heat of  vaporization and liquid density divided by the liquid 
viscosity (for more information see references in Bibliography). G is plotted for 
some fluids over the temperature in Figure 4-2. The heat transport capability of 
a capillary pumped loop is proportional to these curves.

Generally, the applicable temperature range of a TPHTE is subdivided into a 
thermally and a mechanically relevant regime. 
The  thermal  performance  temperature  range,  which  is  used  for  thermal 
qualification,  is  defined  within  the  theoretical  operating  temperature  range, 
confined by the freezing and the critical temperature of the used fluid. Lower 
and upper temperature limits of the qualification range are selected in such a 
way that a useful map of thermal performance data can be established. Within 
this  range  the  maximum  transport  capability  for  qualification  will  be 
determined.  For  a  specific  space  application  the  operating  temperature  range 
(within  the  thermal  performance  temperature  range)  and  the  maximum 
required heat transport capability are specified. 
For thermo-mechanical qualification the temperature range is relevant, to which 
the  device  is  exposed  to  during  the  life  cycle.  In  most  cases  this  exposure 
temperature  range  is  wider  than  the  above-mentioned  thermal  performance 
temperature range. The minimum temperature of this range can be below the 
freezing  temperature  of  the  used  heat  carrier  and  it  is  important  to  take  into 
account possible damage caused by the freezing or thawing effects. The upper 
exposure  temperature  can  be  even  above  the  critical  temperature  of  the  heat 
carrier. This temperature determines in general the maximum internal pressure 
for design and qualification of the device.

The  mentioned  temperature  ranges  and  associated  heat  transport  capabilities 
are illustrated in Figure 4-3.

4.5.2  Mechanical qualification 
TPHTE  are  classified  as  pressurized  component  and  relevant  mechanical 
requirements  are  specified  in  ECSS-ST-E-32-02  and  are  applied  in  the  present 
Standard for all TPHTE types. 
For qualification of a TPHTE as pressurized component the main characteristic 
is the internal pressure, which varies in relation to the exposure temperature of 
the unit (temperature dependent saturation pressure of the heat carrier liquid). 
ECSS-ST-E-32-02 specifies qualification requirements for heat pipes (see figure 
4.12).  The  present  Standard  selects  qualification  requirements  for  TPHTE, 
which  have  seen  proof  pressure  tests  ≥  1,5  MDP.  Testing  is  the  preferred 
method rather than qualification by fracture control analysis.

Constant or static acceleration 
Sine vibration 
Random vibration 

For  qualifying  a  TPHTE  with  respect  to  external  mechanical  environment  the 
following mechanical tests are considered: 
• 
• 
• 
For  these  tests  the  qualification  unit  needs  to  be  rigidly  mounted  to  the  test 
equipment (vibration table). However, such mounting provisions can have only 
reduced similarity to real applications in spacecrafts and the meaningfulness of 
such tests is, therefore, very often reason for discussion under experts. For heat 
pipes it is common understanding not to perform these tests on long heat pipe 
profiles for the following reasons: 
• 

The length of the test heat pipe is adapted to the test equipment and is 
therefore shorter as in many realistic spacecraft applications. 
The  application  of  heat  pipe  is  often  for  embedding  them  in  sandwich 
structures. Mechanical loads for these applications are quite different as 
can be simulated with a rigidly fixed single heat pipe profile. 
Several  capillary  structures,  in  particular  axial  groove  heat  pipes,  are 
quite  insensitive  to  mechanical  loads  and  tests  as  suggested  in  existing 
procedures can be unnecessary. 

• 

• 

For many TPHTE  applications (in particular for devices with simple capillary 
structures,  e.g.  axial  grooves)  the  formal  mechanical  qualification  can  be 
therefore performed with the first structural model on satellite level. In case the 
risk for such a late qualification is high, pre-qualification can be performed on 
unit or part level in particular for the following cases: 
• 

The TPHTE, in particular a heat pipe, has a capillary structure, which is 
sensitive  towards  mechanical  loads,  e.g.  arterial  wick.  In  such  a  case  a 
short piece of the heat pipe profile is selected for mechanical qualification 
testing (sine, random vibration). 
An evaporator of a LHP or CPL can  be  separately tested (sine, random 
vibration) to verify that mechanical requirements are met. 
Equally this can be true for a two-phase loop condenser, in particular for 
configurations where the condenser tubing is embedded into a structural 
panel. 

• 

• 

The  Standard  does  not  therefore  not  specify  at  which  model  level  vibration 
testing is to be performed. The supplier and customer are asked to agree on a 
logical qualification plan, which may include testing at higher than equipment 
level.

This DRD is called from ECSS-E-ST-31-02, requirement 5.1.1b. 

Requirement identification and source document 

Purpose and objective 

A.1.2 
The technical requirements specification (TS) establishes the intended purpose 
of  a  product,  its  associated  constraints  and  environment,  the  operational  and 
performance  features  for  each  relevant  situation  of  its  life  profile,  and  the 
permissible boundaries in terms of technical requirements. 
The TS expresses frozen technical requirements for designing and developing 
the proposed solution to be implemented. These technical requirements, to be 
met  by  the  future  solution,  are  compatible  with  the  intended  purpose  of  a 
product,  its  associated  constraints  and  environment,  and  the  operational  and 
performance features for each relevant situation of its life profile.

User’s need presentation 

The TS shall present the main elements that characterize the user’s need 
for developing the product as a background for those requirements that 
are defined in detail in the dedicated section. 
The TS shall put the product into perspective with other related products.  
If the product is independent and totally self-contained, i.e. able to match 
the final user’s need, it should be so stated here.  
If the TS defines a product that is a component of a higher tier system, 
the  TS  shall  recall  the  related  needs  of  that  larger  system  and  shall 
describe the identified interfaces between that system and the product. 

NOTE  A non-exhaustive checklist of general questions 
that  should  be  answered  at  the  early  stages  of 
the TS is:  
•  What  is  the  product  supposed  to  do?  It  is 
fundamental  but  critically 
important  to 
make  sure  that  every  actor  has  a  complete 
understanding  of  what  the  product  has  to 
do. 

•  Who  is  going  to  use  this  product?  It  is 
important to indicate who is going to use the 
product, why they are going to use it and for 
what it is going to be used. 

Selected concept / product presentation 

The  technical  specification  shall  describe  the  concept,  the  expected 
product architecture and the functioning principles on which it is based. 

Life profile description 

The TS shall list and describe the different chronological situations of the 
product’s life profile.  

NOTE 1  For a spacecraft, the life profile includes: 

transportation to launching area; 

•  AIT related life events; 
• 
•  conditioning and tests; 
installation on launcher; 
• 
•  pre-launch phase; 
launching phase; 
• 
•  self-transfer to its operating position; 
• 
•  end-of-life (e.g. de-orbitation). 

in-orbit functioning; 

NOTE 2  An  identifier  can  be  associated  with  each 
situation  in  order  to  be  able  to  link  each 
requirement to at least one situation in which it

applies.  Such  an  approach  enables  sorting  and 
filtering of the requirements per situation. 

Environment and constraints description 

The TS shall describe the different environments and constraints for each 
situation in the life profile that the product is expected to encounter. 
NOTE  An  identifier  can  be  associated  with  each 
product environment in order to be able to link 
each  requirement

Test specification (TSPE) – DRD 

E.1  DRD identification  

E.1.1 
This DRD is called from ECSS-E-ST-31-02, requirement 5.6.3.1a.1. 

Requirement identification and source document 

Purpose and objective 

E.1.2 
The test specification (TSPE) describes in detail the test requirements applicable 
to any major test activity. In particular, it defines the purpose of the test, the test 
approach, the item under test and the set-up, the required GSE, test tools, test 
instrumentation and measurement accuracy, test conditions, test sequence, test 
facility,  pass/fail  criteria,  required  documentation,  participants  and  test 
schedule. 
Since major test activities often cover multiple activity sheets, the structure of 
the TSPE is adapted accordingly. 
The  TSPE  is  used  as  an  input  to  the  test  procedures,  as  a  requirements 
document for booking the environmental test facility and to provide evidence 
to the customer on certain details of the test activity in advance of the activity 
itself. 
The  TSPE  is  used  at  each  level  of  the  space  system  decomposition  (i.e. 
equipment, space segment element).  
The TSPE provides the requirements for the activities identified in the AITP (as 
defined in Annex A of ECSS-E-ST-10-03). 
The TSPE is used as a basis for writing the relevant test procedures (as defined 
in Annex F) and test report (as defined in Annex C of ECSS-E-ST-10-02). 
In  writing  the  test  specification  potential  overlaps  with  the  test  procedure  is 
minimized  (i.e.  the  test  specification  gives  emphasis  on  requirements,  the  test 
procedure  on  operative  step  by  step  instructions).  For  simple  tests,  merging 
TSPE and TPRO is acceptable. 
The content of this DRD is taken “as is” from ECSS-E-ST-10-03 Annex B.

Annex F (normative) 
Test procedure (TPRO) – DRD 

F.1  DRD identification 

F.1.1 
This DRD is called from ECSS-E-ST-31-02, requirement 5.6.3.1a.2. 

Requirement identification and source document 

Purpose and objective 

F.1.2 
The  Test  Procedure  (TPRO)  gives  directions  for  conducting  a  test  activity  in 
terms  of  description,  resources,  constraints  and  step-by-step  procedure,  and 
provides  detailed  step-by-step  instructions  for  conducting  test  activities  with 
the selected test facility and set-up in agreement with the relevant AITP and the 
test  requirements.  It  contains  the  activity  objective,  the  applicable  documents, 
the  references  to  the  relevant  test  specification  and 
the  test  facility 
configuration, the participants required, the list of configured items under test 
and tools and the step-by-step activities. 
The  TPRO  is  used  and  filled-in  as  appropriate  during  the  execution  and 
becomes the “as-run” procedure. 
The TPRO is prepared for each test to be conducted at each verification level. 
The same procedure can be used in case of recurring tests. 
It  incorporates  the  requirements  of  the  test  specification  (DRD  Annex  E)  and 
uses  detailed  information  contained  in  other  project  documentation  (e.g. 
drawings, ICDs). 
Several  procedures  often  originate  from  a  single  test  specification.  In  certain 
circumstances involving a test facility (for example during environmental tests) 
several test procedures can be combined in an overall integrated test procedure. 
The  “as-run”  procedure  becomes  part  of  the  relevant  test  report  (see  ECSS-E-
ST-10-02).  
Overlaps with the test specification are minimized (see Annex E). 
The content of this DRD is taken “as is” from ECSS-E-ST-10-03 Annex C.
